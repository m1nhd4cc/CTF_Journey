1. Decode the Base32 string
2. Use dCode Cipher Identifier "https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier" to identify the cipher used. The result is a ROT47 cipher.
3. Decode the string using ROT47 cipher. The result is a Base64 string.
4. Decode the Base64 string. The result is a gibberish string.
5. Find the pattern in the gibberish string use XOR with the flag format CIT{. It will reveal the key used to XOR the string, which is "duck"
6. Use the key to XOR the gibberish string.
