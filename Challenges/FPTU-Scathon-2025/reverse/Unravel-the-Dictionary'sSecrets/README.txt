You are provided with a Java-based dictionary application packaged in the JAR file ReferCodeForAssignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. This program, compiled with JDK 17 and executable with JRE 11, employs a custom Dependency Injection (DI) pattern to wire its components. During initialization, the application injects dependencies into specific attributes of its components in a precise order.

Your task is to decompile the JAR, analyze the source code, and determine the order of the classes that contain the attributes receiving injected dependencies. List the fully qualified class names (e.g., package.ClassName) in the exact sequence that their attributes are injected, with each injection of an attribute corresponding to one entry in the list. The flag, in the format:

FUSec2025{package.ClassName1 package.ClassName2 package.ClassName3 ...}

it represents the sequence of injected dependencies. Can you unravel the mystery and claim the flag?
