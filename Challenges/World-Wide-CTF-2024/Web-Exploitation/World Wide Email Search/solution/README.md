This is a variant of a previous [challenge](https://github.com/spipm/BraekerCTF_2024_public/tree/main/challenges/webservices/a-beacon-dialing-home) I made for the Braeker CTF, which was about SQL-Injection via [phone numbers](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/phone-number-injections). Phone numbers have been changed to email addresses, because email addresses can [also allow SQL-Injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/email-injections).

The challenge can be exploited by performing SQL-Injection via [unicode injection](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/unicode-injection). The challenge removes the characters ', " and \ from user input, but unicode normalization causes %CD%B4 to become a single quote, allowing SQL-Injection. An exploit looks like `/?email=foo%2B%CD%B4/**/UNION/**/SELECT/**/flag/**/from/**/flagz--%40bar.com`. See [this](https://www.thesecuritywind.com/post/world-wide-ctf-2024-world-wide-email-search-web) perfect write-up for details.
