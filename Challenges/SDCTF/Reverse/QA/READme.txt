Here at the flag factory, we like to make sure our flags are correct. A few months ago, our QA team have developed an advanced flag examination software, but it has seen little use due to a recent drop in customers. We are releasing its source code to the public to evade tariffs as we move our factory outside of China.

To ensure the TSA have not hijacked our software, you may use this checksum to ensure its integrity.
