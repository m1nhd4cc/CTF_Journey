I just finished writing my very own super secret encryption program. I'm so confident in its security that I'll give you the binary and the output of my program! Bet you can't figure out the secret I gave it >:)

Output of the program: bypkrpihayqo

Note: put the input to the program inside sdctf{} before submitting
